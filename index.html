    <h3>Modern Layouts</h3>
    <section class="column">
          <p>Sub-pixel rendering is tricky. You can't actually expect a monitor to render a less than a pixel thin line. But it's possible to provide sub-pixel dimensions. Depending on the browser they render these differently. Check this John Resig's blog post about it. Basically if your monitor is an LCD and you're drawing vertical lines, you can easily draw a 1/3 pixel line. If your background is white, give your line colour of #f0f. To the eye this line will be 1/3 of pixel wide. Although it will be of some colour, if you'd magnify monitor, you'd see that only one segment of the whole pixel (consisting of RGB) will be dark. This is pretty much technique that's used for fine type.</p>
